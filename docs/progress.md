### üöß In Progress

_No tasks currently in progress_

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

**Issue 1: ALLOWED_ORIGINS JSON Parsing Error**

- **Problem:** pydantic-settings tried to parse comma-separated string "http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000" as JSON array, causing `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError`
- **Impact:** Initial configuration validation failed, delayed testing by ~10 minutes
- **Solution:** Changed field type from `List[str]` to `Optional[str]` and created `get_allowed_origins()` helper method to manually parse comma-separated values
- **Time Lost:** 10 minutes
- **Prevention:** Document pattern for comma-separated environment variables

**Issue 2: Extra Fields Validation Error**

- **Problem:** .env file contained `DEV_USER_EMAIL` and `DEV_USER_PASSWORD` fields not defined in Settings schema, causing ValidationError: "Extra inputs are not permitted"
- **Impact:** Settings couldn't load, delayed by ~5 minutes
- **Solution:** Added `extra = "ignore"` to Settings.Config class to ignore undefined environment variables
- **Time Lost:** 5 minutes
- **Prevention:** Either add all dev fields to Settings or use ignore mode

**Issue 3: asyncpg Module Not Found (UNRESOLVED)**

- **Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'asyncpg'` - asyncpg requires Rust compiler for building from source on Windows with Python 3.13
- **Impact:** Server cannot start, database operations blocked
- **Solution:** Not yet resolved. Options:
  1. Install Rust toolchain (rustup) and Visual Studio Build Tools
  2. Use Docker container with pre-built dependencies
  3. Use Python 3.11 where precompiled wheels available
  4. Wait for asyncpg to publish Python 3.13 wheels
- **Time Lost:** Not counted (documented for next session)
- **Status:** BLOCKING - Need to resolve before continuing with database work

**Issue 4: ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES Parsing (Same as Issue 1)**

- **Problem:** Same JSON parsing issue for comma-separated file type list
- **Impact:** Minimal, same pattern as ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- **Solution:** Same pattern - changed to `Optional[str]` and created `get_allowed_file_types()` helper
- **Time Lost:** 2 minutes (pattern already established)

### üí° Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Use pydantic-settings for Configuration**

- **Rationale:**
  - Type-safe configuration with validation
  - Automatic .env file loading
  - Integration with FastAPI ecosystem
  - Better than manual os.getenv() calls
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - python-decouple (less type-safe)
  - dynaconf (more complex than needed)
  - Manual os.getenv() (no validation)
- **Impact:** All configuration centralized in Settings class with validation

**Decision 2: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with Async Pattern**

- **Rationale:**
  - Modern async/await pattern for better performance
  - Native async support in FastAPI
  - Future-proof (SQLAlchemy 2.0 is latest major version)
  - Better for high-concurrency workloads
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - SQLAlchemy 1.4 with sync (outdated)
  - Raw asyncpg (less abstraction, more boilerplate)
  - Tortoise ORM (smaller ecosystem)
- **Impact:** Need to use async/await everywhere, all DB operations are non-blocking

**Decision 3: Structured Logging with File Rotation**

- **Rationale:**
  - Production-ready logging from day 1
  - Daily rotation prevents disk space issues
  - Structured format makes log parsing easier
  - Separate console and file outputs
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Basic print() statements (not production-ready)
  - External logging service only (want local logs too)
  - Single log file (would grow indefinitely)
- **Impact:** All application events logged consistently, easy debugging

**Decision 4: Standard Error Response Format**

- **Rationale:**
  - Consistent error handling across all endpoints
  - Frontend can parse errors predictably
  - Request ID tracking for debugging
  - Follows REST best practices
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - FastAPI default error format (less structured)
  - Custom format per endpoint (inconsistent)
  - Plain text errors (harder to parse)
- **Impact:** All errors follow {success, data, error, timestamp} format

**Decision 5: Comma-Separated Strings for Lists in .env**

- **Rationale:**
  - .env files don't support arrays natively
  - Simpler than JSON strings in environment variables
  - Easy to read and modify
  - Standard pattern in many frameworks
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - JSON arrays in .env (harder to read, escaping issues)
  - Multiple env variables (ALLOWED_ORIGIN_1, _2, _3) (inflexible)
  - Config file (adds another file to manage)
- **Impact:** Need helper methods to parse comma-separated values

### üìù Notes & Observations

- FastAPI's automatic API documentation (/api/docs) is excellent for development
- pydantic-settings validation is strict but catches configuration errors early
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async syntax is cleaner than 1.4 (no more `select(...).execution_options(...)`)
- Python 3.13 is very new (Sept 2024), some packages don't have precompiled wheels yet
- Windows requires Visual Studio Build Tools + Rust for some Python packages
- Supabase connection string format: postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db

**Reminders for Next Session:**

- Resolve asyncpg installation (Docker or Rust toolchain)
- Test database connection once asyncpg installed
- Start Day 2: Create SQLAlchemy models (User, Wallet, Transaction)
- Consider using Python 3.11 in Docker if 3.13 causes more issues

### üìà Metrics

- **Lines of Code:** +850 (all new)
- **Files Created:** 12
  - 7 Python modules (.py)
  - 3 Configuration files (.env, .env.example, .gitignore)
  - 1 Requirements file (requirements.txt)
  - 1 Package init (__init__.py)
- **Tests Written:** 0 (manual testing only)
- **Tests Passing:** N/A
- **Bugs Fixed:** 3 (ALLOWED_ORIGINS parsing, extra fields, ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES)
- **New Bugs:** 1 (asyncpg installation blocked)
- **Configuration Variables:** 40+ environment variables defined

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Session Plan

**Priority Tasks:**

1. [P0] Resolve asyncpg installation issue - Est: 30-60 min
   - Option A: Install Rust + VS Build Tools
   - Option B: Use Docker with Python 3.11 or 3.12
   - Option C: Downgrade to Python 3.11
2. [P0] Test database connection to Supabase - Est: 15 min
3. [P0] Create User model with SQLAlchemy - Est: 45 min
4. [P0] Create Wallet model with balance tracking - Est: 30 min
5. [P0] Create Transaction model for history - Est: 45 min

**Blocked Tasks:**

- All database-related tasks blocked until asyncpg installation resolved

**Questions/Unknowns:**

- Should we use Docker from the start to avoid Python environment issues?
- Is Python 3.13 too new for production use?
- Do we need database migrations (Alembic) from day 1 or can we add later?

- **Time Spent:** 2 hours
- **Testing:**
  - Migration runs successfully: ‚úÖ
  - All tables created in Supabase: ‚úÖ
  - Relationships working: ‚úÖ
  - Unique constraints enforced: ‚úÖ
- **Notes:**
  - Used UUID for all primary keys (better for distributed systems)
  - Added composite indexes on (user_id, created_at) for transactions table
  - Implemented soft deletes (is_active flag) instead of hard deletes

### üöß In Progress

**[P0] Implement User Registration Endpoint**

- **Progress:** 60% complete
- **Remaining Work:**
  - Add email verification flow
  - Write unit tests
  - Test edge cases
- **Estimated Time:** 1 hour
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Implement Twilio SMS OTP verification
  2. Create Pydantic schemas for validation
  3. Write 5 unit tests covering all cases

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

**Supabase Connection String Format**

- **Problem:** Initial connection string format caused SSL verification errors
- **Impact:** Lost 20 minutes debugging connection issues
- **Solution:** Added `?sslmode=require` to connection string
- **Time Lost:** 20 minutes
- **Documented In:** ERRORS.md (will add if issue recurs)

**Alembic Auto-generate Limitations**

- **Problem:** Alembic didn't detect JSON columns correctly
- **Impact:** Had to manually edit migration file
- **Solution:** Explicitly defined JSONB type in models
- **Time Lost:** 15 minutes
- **Prevention:** Document JSONB usage pattern for future migrations

### üí° Decisions Made

**Decision: Use UUID instead of Integer for Primary Keys**

- **Rationale:**
  - Better for distributed systems
  - Prevents ID enumeration attacks
  - Easier to merge databases if needed
  - No performance impact with proper indexing
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Integer IDs (simpler but less secure)
  - ULID (not natively supported by PostgreSQL)
- **Impact:** All models use UUID, need to handle as strings in frontend

**Decision: Custodial Wallet Model**

- **Rationale:**
  - Simpler UX (users don't manage keys)
  - Faster transactions (internal transfers, no blockchain)
  - Lower costs (only use blockchain for in/out)
  - Easier to implement in 8 weeks
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Non-custodial (too complex for MVP, poor UX)
  - Hybrid (adds complexity without clear benefit)
- **Impact:**
  - We manage hot wallet security
  - Internal transfers are free and instant
  - Need robust audit logging

### üìù Notes & Observations

- Supabase dashboard is excellent for monitoring database in real-time
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async syntax is significantly different from 1.x (using `await` everywhere)
- Need to be careful with Decimal precision for financial calculations (use quantize)
- Consider adding database triggers for audit logging (vs application-level)

**Reminders for Next Session:**

- Test all database constraints thoroughly
- Add indexes for frequently queried columns
- Setup database backup verification

### üìà Metrics

- **Lines of Code:** +650 (all new)
- **Files Created:** 12
